# EECS X497.32 - Fundamentals of Embedded Systems Design and Programming  

## Course Description  
Gain an overview of embedded systems applications and design procedures, and learn how to plan and execute complete embedded systems designs that are
cost-effective and competitive. You will gain the knowledge needed to determine and document system requirements for new designs as well as for
improving existing systems. In addition you will learn analysis techniques for optimizing system specifications as well as selecting microcontrollers
for specific designs. Hands-on development is facilitated with the XMEGA-A3BU embedded system development kit.

## Course Goals  
At the end of this course, students will be able to:  
 - Describe the various components of an embedded system  
 - Perform timing analysis  
 - Analyze memory requirements and select appropriate devices  
 - Design interrupt service routines and understand their unique structure  
 - Build embedded programs and upload them into the target machine  
 - Describe the basic software architectures
